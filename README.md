Typescript/Javascript Practice

TS/JS files do not run natively!
Need a runner like Deno or NodeJs to run these files

run files with;
    deno run $name
    OR
    ts-node $name
    OR
    node $name
    OR
    npm start $name
where $name is the filename

run tests with
    deno test $name
    OR
    npm test $name
where $name is the filename. $name is optional!
